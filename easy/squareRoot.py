'''
69. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
    - For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.
